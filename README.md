# Ensemble-ML-Algorithms-Tutorial

In this tutorial we will look at two widely-used tree models - Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) and Random Forest. Both are ensembled methods, as both of them construct multiple simple trees and then aggregate them to yield better results. We are interested in seeing how the two models behave in different types of data.
